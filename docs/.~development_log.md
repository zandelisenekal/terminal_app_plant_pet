##### 1. Location

Original plan: The user would have been able to change the location of the plant. The location of the plant would be stored in an instance variable called "location" which would have been created when initializing the class Plant_pet. The initialize method would take the location of the plant as input in the method when creating a new plant. The default location when creating a new plant would be "inside".

The user would then have the option to move the plant outside which would change the location variable value to "outside".

This idea was mostly changed before starting to create the location feature and later it was changed all together.

Now the user's plant will always be inside. The user has the option to move the plant outside and the game prompts the user to enter for how long they want to keep the plant outside - where after the plant "automatically" moves back inside - thus no more need for a location variable.
