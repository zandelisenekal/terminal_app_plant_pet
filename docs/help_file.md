#### Help file

To run this application the user will need a functioning computer or laptop. Mac and Linux works well. If the user is on a Windows, I would recommend the user to install WSL Ubuntu for a smoother function of this application. The user will then be able to run the application from any terminal or bash they prefer. The user will see that there are a couple ruby files and one script file named run_app.sh. This is the file which will run the whole application.

##### Instructions

Open the terminal in bash. Type 'bash run_app.sh' in the terminal:

```
bash run_app.sh
```

The command will open and run the game which will include all the necessary gems to run the application. The game will prompt the user with options to choose from to play the game.

Type 'y' to start a new game and ENJOY!
